SudokuSolver
============

A sudoku solver I wrote while stranded on a delayed plane!

This program implements a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve any 9 x 9 sudoku puzzle.

**Steps**

1. Create a text file that matches the formatting of the example board text files included in the repo.
2. Change ``creator.createBoard("yourfilehere.txt")`` 
3. run ``SudokuSolver.java ``
